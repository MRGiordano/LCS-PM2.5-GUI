# LCS-PM2.5-GUI

This simple GUI is to take (1) file with Low-cost PM2.5 sensor data and (1) file with reference-grade monitor data and perform a multi-linear regression with options to include or exclude certain terms from the regression formula, the amount of training/testing data, regridding data to higher time averages, and automatically performing some minor cleanup of the input files. Option also exists to fit (2) regressions by setting a breakpoint in the data (see Malings et al., 2020 for reasons why this can be beneficial).
